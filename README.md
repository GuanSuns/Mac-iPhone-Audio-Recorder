# Mac-iPhone-Audio-Recorder


## PortAudio Plugin
- To start recording, click the Start Recording button on the GUI; to stop, click the Stop Recording button.
- The current codes are able to record audio while playing a previously-recorded pcm file (generated by App using 5000 Hz).
- The audio in the first 20 seconds will be saved in the pcm file /tmp/recorded.pcm
- You can change the configuration of input format in PortAudioPlugin.h. However, the setting of output format is fixed (48000 sample rate, int16, 1 channel), since it need to be consistent with the format of the played pcm file.
- The recorded pcm file will be played continuously and repeatedly. There seems to be a small gap when reaching the end of the pcm data. However, everything can be controlled by codes (you can see function playCallback). If we can generate audio using codes, there should be no gap in the loop.
